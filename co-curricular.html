      Traditional classroom teaching is not entirely sufficient for the
      overall<br />
      development of the modern day student. Brookhurst’s co-curricular<br />
      activities fills the missing gaps and creates an interesting niche for
      the<br />
      child. While traditional classrooms are generally designed to dvelop a<br />
      child’s theoretical knowledge, the other aspects of learning such as
      moral<br />
      develoment, social development, creative development, civic
      development,<br />
      emotional and physical development of the child are greatly enhanced by<br />
      co-curricular activities.

      <h4 style="color: darkblue;">Music</h4>
      <p>
        Brookhurst focuses in ensuring the musical talents of our students
        are<br />
        discovered and explored. We provide the necessary musical instruments
        to<br />
        ensure students fine tune their talents. Brookhurst’s staffed with
        notable<br />
        music instructors who have been nurturing musical talent over a number
        of<br />
        years. The world will never say no to a good tune.
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: darkblue;">Drama</h4>
      <p>
        At Brookhurst we believe drama helps to develop confidence, team
        building<br />
        skills and lays the foundation for a life-long enjoyment of the Arts.
        The<br />
        students are also introduced to story-making techniques and enjoy
        creating<br />
        many short plays of their own during Speech and Drama sessions. All
        of<br />
        these activities contribute to building their confidence and
        imagination.<br />
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: darkblue;">ART</h4>
      <p>
        Various displays throughout the school give an insight into the
        students’<br />
        artistic activities. During weekly art lessons students explore a
        variety<br />
        of art techniques, practice skills and develop their imagination.
        This<br />
        continuous practice enables the students to tackle increasingly
        elaborate<br />
        art projects, developing their creativity even further.<br />

      <h4>AVIATION</h4>
      <p>
        At Brookhurst we ensure our students become the best at what they do<br />
        hence our training at the flying training center at Wilson Airport,<br />
        Kenya The students are then certified and given (PPL) that is
